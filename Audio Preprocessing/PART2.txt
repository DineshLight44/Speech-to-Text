- data, rate = sf.read("noisy.wav")
Python knows what goes into data and what goes into rate because the sf.read() function is designed to return exactly two values in order:
*First value: the audio data (the sound samples)
*Second value: the sample rate (how many samples per second)

- MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
* MFCC is a way to turn sound into a set of numbers.
* It captures the important patterns of human speech.
* Models use MFCCs instead of raw audio because it compresses whatâ€™s most useful for understanding speech.
Why do models use MFCC?
*Simplifies audio: Only keeps features important for recognizing voices.
*Matches how humans hear: Focuses on frequency bands people use when talking.

In Summary
Noise removal makes sound clear.
Normalization evens out volume.
MP3 to WAV converts format for model use.
MFCC shrinks audio to useful speech features for machine learning.
